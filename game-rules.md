# Game Rules

## The Goal
The goal is to enclose a territory with the observed border and a safe land without foe's inside.

## Player
- Player (or first person, or simply "you") has a finite life, every turn they get older, and at some point they die even if not killed earlier.
- You have **power** (maximum of your strength) and **knowledge** (maximum of smartness).

## Foes & fights
- Rogues and magi are two types of foes, rogues only have strength and magi only have smartness.
- Rogues and magi roam the map randomly, when they see you in the plains and are superior (in strength or smartness respectively) they approach you for a fight.
- Foes cannot see you in the forest to change their route but can randomly stumble upon you and fight.
- You win a foe if you have more strength (or smartness). You get +1 to power or knowledge as the result.
- You get killed if your strength/smartness is x2 lower than foe's. If your strength/smartness is less than foe's but not x2 less - you are left with 1 strength/smartness.
- Strength and smartness regenerate by 1 each turn if not in fight and by extra 1 if staying without a move.

## Map
- Map has plains, forest (where you can hide) and mountains (unpassable).
- You get more range to uncover map as your knowledge increases.
- Map landscape stays discovered but out-of-distance foes are not seen.

## Fortress
- You can build a fortress with its strength for defense equal to your current smartness.
- Fortress has a visibility range. Foes are always seen in that range and that range is your territory.
- A rogue destroys the fortress if they are stronger, if they are weaker - they are killed if being 2 turns in range of the fortress. If they have equal strength - no one is hurt.
- A magi captures a fortress if their smartness is higher than fortress's defense strength. After being captured fortress's strength is upgraded to the magi's smartness.
- If you lose a fortress, you lose the territory and the visibility in it's range.
- If you are smarter than fortress defense you can recapture it, it's strength doesn't change.
- If you are not smarter but stronger - you destroy the foe's fortress.
- If you are weaker and appear in a distance of a fortress for 2 turns you are attacked same as by a rogue but at a distance - 2x to be killed, 1 strength for less.
